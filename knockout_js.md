# KnockoutJS

- An MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) framework; features of which include (according to wikipedia):
    - a clear separation between domain data, view components, and data to be displayed
    - the presence of a clearly defined layer of specialized code to manage the relationships between the view components
- Author, Steve Sanderson, is an employee of Microsoft, but stresses that Knockout is an open-source personal project; NOT related to Microsoft in any way.
- Includes declarative binding, automatic UI refresh (updates upon data model state change), dependency tracking, templating
- Extremely small/compact
- Works on all mainstream browsers
- Can be added to existing web apps "without requiring major architectural changes" (from KnockoutJS introduction)
- Not designed to compete with JQuery, but rather to function as a complimentary link between a data model and a UI. Does not depend on, can be used in conjunction with JQuery.
